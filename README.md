## Introduction

Welcome to our Netflix Movie Recommender System! This project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history, similar to how Netflix suggests content to its users. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and movie metadata to generate recommendations.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Our recommender system tailors movie recommendations to each user's tastes and preferences.
- **Netflix-Like User Interface**: The frontend of our application resembles the Netflix landing page, providing users with a familiar and intuitive browsing experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices of all sizes.

## How It Works
1. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Our recommendation engine employs various machine learning algorithms, such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, to generate personalized recommendations.
2. **Recommendation Generation**: Based on the user's profile and viewing history, the system generates a list of recommended movies.
3. **Frontend Display**: The recommended movies are displayed on the frontend, resembling the Netflix landing page, with detailed information about each movie.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/tmdb-top-10000-popular-movies-dataset
- **Machine Learning**: Mostly cosine_similarity
